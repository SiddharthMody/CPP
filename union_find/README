Algorithm    :  Initialize : Union   : Connected
quick-find   :    N        :  N      :    1
quick-union  :    N        :  N      :    N
Weighted QU  :    N        :  lg(N)  :    lg(N)
where lg = log to base 2


Weighted QU with Path Compression = lg(N) --> constant time. Thereby making it linear runtime
To do so make every other node in path point to its grandparents. This keeps tree completely flat:

"
..
id[i] = id[id[i]]
i = id[i]
...
"
